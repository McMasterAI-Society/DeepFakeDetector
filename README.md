# ðŸ§  DeepFakeDetector â€“ AI-Generated Image Detection  


## ðŸ“– Overview
**DeepFakeDetector** is a research and development project by members of the **McMaster Artificial Intelligence Society** focused on detecting AI-generated and deepfake images.  

With the rapid advancement of image synthesis models like **StyleGAN**, **Stable Diffusion**, and **DALLÂ·E**, distinguishing synthetic content from authentic media has become increasingly difficult. This project aims to address that challenge by training models capable of detecting subtle visual artifacts that reveal an imageâ€™s generative origin.

Our system will combine multiple approaches:
- **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)** for spatial feature detection.  
- **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** for global context understanding.  
- **Frequency-domain analysis (FFT)** to capture artifacts invisible in the pixel domain.  

The final product will be a **web-based dashboard** that allows users to upload an image and receive:
- A real vs. AI-generated classification score.  
- A visual explanation (saliency or attention map) showing why the image was flagged.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
To create a reliable, interpretable, and accessible AI system that:
1. Accurately detects AI-generated and deepfake images.  
2. Provides visual explanations to promote transparency and trust in AI systems.  
3. Offers a usable web platform for real-time image authenticity verification.  
4. Contributes open research and tools to the broader AI ethics and misinformation-detection community.
